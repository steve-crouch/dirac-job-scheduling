## Selecting Resources for Jobs

### Determining Queues to which you have Access

Before we submit a job, we need to specify a queue to which it will be submitted.
You can find out the queues you have access rights for, and their state, using:

~~~
sinfo -s
~~~
{: .language-bash}

The `-s` curtails the output to only a summary,
whereas using this flag provides a full listing of nodes in each queue and their current state.

You should see something like the following, although this will vary for each DiRAC resource:

~~~
PARTITION         AVAIL  TIMELIMIT   NODES(A/I/O/T) NODELIST
cosma7               up 3-00:00:00     80/137/7/224 m[7229-7452]
cosma7-pauper        up 1-00:00:00     80/137/7/224 m[7229-7452]
cosma7-shm           up 3-00:00:00          0/1/0/1 mad02
cosma7-shm-pauper    up 1-00:00:00          0/1/0/1 mad02
cosma7-bench         up 1-00:00:00          0/0/1/1 m7452
cosma7-rp            up 3-00:00:00     82/140/2/224 m[7001-7224]
cosma7-rp-pauper*    up 1-00:00:00     82/140/2/224 m[7001-7224]
~~~
{: .output}

Here we can see the general availability of each of these queues (also known as partitions), as well as the maximum
time limit for jobs on each of these queues (in `days-hours:minutes:seconds` format).
For example, on the `cosma7` queue there is a 3-day limit, whilst the `cosma7-pauper` queue has a 1-day limit.

Of particular interest is the `NODES` column, which gives us an overview of the state of these resources, and hence
allows us to select those resources that are sufficiently available for jobs we'd like to submit.
It indicates how many nodes are:

- `A`ctive - these are running jobs
- `I`dle - no jobs are running
- `O`ther - these nodes are down, or otherwise unavailable
- The `T`otal number of nodes

The `NODELIST` is a summary of those nodes in a particular queue.

### Specifying Job Resource Requirements

One thing that is absolutely critical when working on an HPC system
is specifying the resources required to run a job, which allows the scheduler to
find the right time and place to schedule our job. If you do not specify
requirements (such as the amount of time you need), you will likely be stuck
with your site's default resources, which is probably not what you want.

When launching a job, we can specify the resources our job needs in our job script,
using `#SBATCH <parameter>`. We've used this format before when indicating the account and queue to use.
You may have seen some of these parameters before, but let's take a look at the most important
ones and how they relate to each other.

For these parameters, by default a *task* refers to a single CPU unless otherwise indicated.

- `--nodes` - the total number of machines or nodes to request
- `--ntasks` - the total number of CPU cores (across requested nodes) your job needs. Generally, this will be 1 unless you're running MPI jobs which are
able to use multiple CPU cores. In which case, it essentially specifies the number of MPI ranks to start across the nodes. For example, if `--nodes=4` and `--ntasks=8`, we're requesting 4 nodes each with 2 CPUs. We'll see an example of using `--ntasks` with MPI in a later episode.

{: .challenge}

We can also specify the number of CPUs to request per node explicitly using `--ntasks-per-node`. In this case, we
use this with `--nodes` and we don't need to specify `--ntasks` at all. So using our above example with `--nodes=4`,
to get our desired total 8 CPUs we'd specify `--ntasks-per-node=2`.

We'll be looking at how we can make full use of these parameters with MPI jobs later in this lesson.

Up until now, the number of tasks have been synonymous with the number of CPUs. However, we can also specify a multiple
number of CPUs per task too, by using `--cpus-per-task` - so if your job is multithreaded, for example it makes use of
OpenMP, you can specify how many threads it needs using this parameter.

## Managing Job Submissions

### Monitoring a Job

As we've seen, we can check on our job's status by using the command `squeue`. Let's take a look in more detail.

~~~
squeue -u yourUsername
~~~
{: .language-bash}

You may find it looks like this:

~~~
  JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
5791510 cosma7-pa example- yourUser PD       0:00      1 (Priority)
~~~
{: .output}

So `-u yourUsername` shows us all jobs associated with our machine account. We can also use `-j` to query specific
job IDs, e.g.: `squeue -j 5791510` which will, in this case, yield the same information since we only have that job
in the queue (if it hasn't already completed!).

In either case, we can see all the details of our job, including the partition, user, and also the state of the job (in the `ST` column).
In this case, we can see it is in the PD or PENDING state.
Typically, a successful job run will go through the following states:

- `PD` - *pending*: sometimes our jobs might need to wait in a queue first before they can be allocated to a node to run. 
- `R` - *running*: job has an allocation and is currently running
- `CG` - *completing*: job is in the process of completing
- `CD` - *completed*: the job is completed

For pending jobs, helpfully, you may see a reason for this in the `NODELIST(REASON)` column;
for example, that the nodes required for the job are down or reserved for other jobs,
or that the job is queued behind a higher priority job that is making use of the requested resources.
Once it's able to run, the nodes that have been allocated will be displayed in this column instead.

However, there are a number of reasons why jobs may end due to a failure or other condition, including:

- `OOM` - *ouf of memory*: the job attempted to use more memory during execution than what was available
- `S` - *suspended*: job has an allocation, but it has been suspended to allow for other jobs to use the resources
- `CA` - *cancelled*: the job was explicitly cancelled, either by the user or system administrator, and may or may not have been started
- `F` - *failed*: the job has terminated with a non-zero exit code or has failed for another reason

You can get a full list of job status codes via the [SLURM documentation](https://slurm.schedmd.com/squeue.html#lbAG).

### Cancelling a Job

Sometimes we'll make a mistake and need to cancel a job. This can be done with
the `scancel` command. Let's submit a job and then cancel it using
its job number (remember to change the walltime so that it runs long enough for
you to cancel it before it is killed!).

~~~
sbatch example-job.sh
squeue -u yourUsername
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
Submitted batch job 5791551

  JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
5791551 cosma7-pa hello-wo yourUser PD       0:00      1 (Priority)
~~~
{: .output}

Now cancel the job with its job number (printed in your terminal). A clean
return of your command prompt indicates that the request to cancel the job was
successful.

~~~
scancel 5791551
# It might take a minute for the job to disappear from the queue...
squeue -u yourUsername
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
...(no output when there are no jobs to display)...
~~~
{: .output}

> ## Cancelling multiple jobs
>
> We can also cancel all of our jobs at once using the -u option. This will delete all jobs for a specific user (in this case, yourself). Note that you can only delete your own jobs.

### Backfilling

When developing code or testing configurations it is usually the case that you don’t need a lot of time.
When that is true and the queues are busy backfilling can be really useful.

If there are idle nodes then that means they are available to run jobs, or that they are being kept so that a
job can run in the future. The time between when a job needs those nodes and now is the backfill window
and jobs that need less than that time will be scheduled to run. To take best advantage of backfilling, 
specify a shorter time period for jobs.

You can check if a particular Slurm scheduler is configured to use a backfill technique by doing the following:

~~~
scontrol show config | grep SchedulerType
~~~
{: .language-bash}

This use of the `scontrol` command allows us to see the configuration of Slurm, and by piping its output (using `|`) to
the `grep` command, we can search for a particular configuration field called `SchedulerType` which holds the method used
for scheduling. If a backfill scheduler is being used, you should see the following:

~~~
SchedulerType           = sched/backfill
~~~
{: .output}

If the `builtin` scheduler is used instead, then jobs will be executed in order of submission, regardless if there
are any free resources to run your job immediately.

### Inspecting and Controlling the State of Jobs

So far we've used the `squeue` command to check the general status of pending and running jobs. But we can also obtain
even more information using the `scontrol` command regarding the job's status, configuration and use of resources.

Let's create a new job to test this, that uses a single node and a single CPU on that node to run a single basic task:

~~~
#!/usr/bin/env bash
#SBATCH --account=yourAccount
#SBATCH --partition=aPartition
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=1
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1
#SBATCH --ntasks=1
#SBATCH --time=00:00:30
#SBATCH --job-name=specific-job

sleep 25
echo "This script is running on ... "
hostname
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Next, launch our new job:

~~~
sbatch specific-job.sh
~~~
{: .language-bash}

...then make a note of the job ID returned, e.g.:

~~~
...
Submitted batch job 6484453
~~~
{: .output}

We can then use this job ID to ask Slurm for more information about it:

~~~
scontrol show jobid=6484453
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
JobId=6484457 JobName=specific-job
   UserId=yourUsername(21859) GroupId=yourAccount(20133) MCS_label=N/A

   StdOut=/cosma/home/yourAccount/userHome/slurm-6484457.out
   Power=
~~~
{: .output}

In particular, we can see:

- As we might expect the `JobState` is `RUNNING`, although it may be `PENDING` if waiting to be assigned to a node, or if we weren't fast enough running the `scontrol` command it might be `COMPLETED`
- How long the job has run for (`RunTime`), and the job's maximum specified duration (`TimeLimit`)
- The job's `SubmitTime`, as well as the job's `StartTime` for execution: this may be the actual start time, or the expected start time if set in the future. The expected `EndTime` is also specified, although if it isn't specified directly in the job script this isn't always exactly `StartTime` + specified duration; it's often rounded up, perhaps to the nearest minute.
- The queue assigned for the job is the `cosma7-pauper` queue, and that the job is running on the `m7401` node
- The resources assigned to the job are a single node (`NumNodes=1`) with 28 CPU cores, for a single task with 1 CPU core per task. Pretty much as we would expect given what we requested in our job script, although note that we may get more resources than what we asked for. For example in this instance, we can see that we actually obtained a node with 28 CPUs (although we won't use them)
- We didn't specify a working directory within which to execute the job, so the default `WorkDir` is our home directory
- The error and output file locations, as specified by `StdErr` and `StdOut`

You can find more information on `scontrol` and the various fields in the [Slurm documentation](https://slurm.schedmd.com/scontrol.html).

Note that typing `scontrol` on its own will enter an interactive state with an `scontrol` prompt which allows
you to enter subcommands (like `show` or `update`) directly to the `scontrol` command. You can exit by typing `quit`.

## Querying Job Resources

For more detail about jobs and the resources, there are two key Slurm commands we can use to give us more information about jobs
that are either actively running (using `sstat`) or completed (using `sacct`).

### Querying Running Jobs

First, submit our previous job script `specific-job.sh` using `sbatch`,
then check when it's actually running using `squeue` (since `sstat` will only work on actively running jobs),
and then when we know it's running we can use `sstat` to query which resources it's using.
Note that it's probably a good idea to increase the `25` value for `sleep` in the job script
so you have more time to query the job before it completes!

For example, following submission via `sbatch`:

~~~
squeue -j 6803898
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Wait until it reaches the running state designated by `R`:

~~~
  JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
5791551 cosma7-pa hello-wo yourUser  R       0:00      1 (Priority)
~~~
{: .output}

Since we now know it's running, we may query its active resource usage to date.

~~~
sstat -j 6803898
~~~
{: .language-bash}

The first line of output is presented as a series of columns representing the various properties - or fields - associated with the job,
but unfortunately you'll notice that with so many columns it renders the output quite unreadable!
Fortunately we can select which columns we wish to see, e.g.:

~~~
sstat -j 6803898 --format=JobID,AveCPU,NTasks,MinCPU,MaxDiskWrite
~~~
{: .language-bash}

So here, we've selected a number of field columns we're interested in:

- `JobID` - the ID of the job, useful if we happen to specify multiple jobs to query, e.g. `-j 6803898,6803899,6803900`.
- `AveCPU` - the average CPU time of the job
- `NTasks` - total number of tasks in a job
- `MinCPU` - the minimum CPU time used in a job
- `MaxDiskWrite` - the maximum number of bytes written by the job

But looking at the output, you'll notice there is no information is returned other than the field headers:

~~~
JobID            AveCPU   NTasks     MinCPU MaxDiskWrite
------------ ---------- -------- ---------- ------------ 
~~~
{: .output}

To see information about the job we need to add a flag to the command:

~~~
sstat --allsteps -j 6803898 --format=JobID,AveCPU,NTasks,MinCPU,MaxDiskWrite
~~~
{: .language-bash}

> ## Anatomy of a Job

> This is because, by default, all jobs are actually made up of a number of job *steps*.

And now we should see something like:

~~~
JobID            AveCPU   NTasks     MinCPU MaxDiskWrite
------------ ---------- -------- ---------- ------------
6803898.ext+   00:00:00        1   00:00:00        1.00M
6803898.bat+   00:00:00        1   00:00:00           66
~~~
{: .output}

The `+` indicates the column value is truncated; in this case `ext` refers to `extern`, and `bat` refers to `batch`.

In this trivial case, so far we can see that we've used virtually no actual CPU,
and the batch submission script has written a total of 66 bytes,
with 1MB of other data written by the job's `extern` step.

### Querying Completed Jobs

Once a job is complete, since it only operates on active jobs you'll notice that `sstat` no longer presents resource usage.
For jobs that have completed, we use `sacct`, which displays accounting data for Slurm jobs.

We can first use `sacct` to list the completed jobs for today:

~~~
JobID           JobName  Partition    Account  AllocCPUS      State ExitCode 
------------ ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- -------- 
6803854            bash cosma7-pa+ yourAccou+         28    TIMEOUT      0:0 
6803854.ext+     extern            yourAccou+         28  COMPLETED      0:0 
6803854.0          bash            yourAccou+         28  COMPLETED      0:0 
6803898      specific-+ cosma7-pa+ yourAccou+         28  COMPLETED      0:0 
6803898.bat+      batch            yourAccou+         28  COMPLETED      0:0 
6803898.ext+     extern            yourAccou+         28  COMPLETED      0:0 
6804261_1    hello_wor+ cosma7-pa+ yourAccou+         28  COMPLETED      0:0 
6804261_1.b+      batch            yourAccou+         28  COMPLETED      0:0 
6804261_1.e+     extern            yourAccou+         28  COMPLETED      0:0 
6804261_2    hello_wor+ cosma7-pa+ yourAccou+         28  COMPLETED      0:0 
6804261_2.b+      batch            yourAccou+         28  COMPLETED      0:0 
6804261_2.e+     extern            yourAccou+         28  COMPLETED      0:0 
6804261_3    hello_wor+ cosma7-pa+ yourAccou+         28  COMPLETED      0:0 
6804261_3.b+      batch            yourAccou+         28  COMPLETED      0:0 
6804261_3.e+     extern            yourAccou+         28  COMPLETED      0:0 
~~~
{: .output}

Or, for a specific job:

~~~
sacct -j 6803898
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Which will display accounting information for a given job, including its constituent steps
(and we don't need to use `--allsteps` to collate this information).

By default, we'll see something like the following:

~~~
JobID           JobName  Partition    Account  AllocCPUS      State ExitCode 
------------ ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- -------- 
6803898      specific-+ cosma7-pa+ yourAccou+         28  COMPLETED      0:0 
6803898.bat+      batch            yourAccou+         28  COMPLETED      0:0 
6803898.ext+     extern            yourAccou+         28  COMPLETED      0:0 
~~~
{: .output}

As with `sstat`, we are also able to customise the fields we wish to see, e.g.:

~~~
sacct -j 6803898 --format=JobID,JobName,Partition,Account,AllocCPUS,State,Elapsed,CPUTime
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
JobID           JobName  Partition    Account  AllocCPUS      State    Elapsed    CPUTime 
------------ ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- 
6803898      specific-+ cosma7-pa+ yourAccou+         28  COMPLETED   00:00:25   00:11:40 
6803898.bat+      batch            yourAccou+         28  COMPLETED   00:00:25   00:11:40 
6803898.ext+     extern            yourAccou+         28  COMPLETED   00:00:25   00:11:40
~~~
{: .callout}

As with `sstat`, you can add many [other fields](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sacct.html#SECTION_Job-Accounting-Fields) too,
although note the accounting data presented for these will be different depending on the HPC system's configuration and the job's type.
CPUTime here is equal to `AllocCPUs * Elapsed`, i.e. the number of CPUs allocated to the job multiplied by the total elapsed time.
